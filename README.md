## Yet another react starter kit, but this one works for me.

This will be used as my starting point when working on React + Redux projects. The starter kit features:

- React
- Redux
- React Router
- Webpack 2
- Babel
- SCSS

### Things you'll need

- node.js + nvm

- npm

- yarn

### You know what to do

- Install dependencies with ` yarn install `

- Develop with ` npm start `

### TODO

- [ ] Separate into Dev and Production

- [ ] Add Hot Module Replacement

- [ ] Lint

- [ ] CSS Autoprefixing

- [ ] Testing with Mocha and Chai
